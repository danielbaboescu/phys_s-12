    <p><br>After meddling around with the simple template that was given during class. I browsed around and decided to use the boostrap theme "Simple Me" template and started modifying it. The format was good for me as it allowed me to organize my navigation and documentation so that it would be easier for both me and the audience to view. At first when I was using the simple template, I had a lot of trouble with incorporating different website components that would be used for navigation until I added the template. Throughout this course, I hope to add an overall layer to the design of the website to make it "pop."<br></p>

    <pr><br>I currently have three ideas for my final project. These are listed below:<br><br></pr>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><strong>An automated robot that gets utensils/tools for me:</strong><br><br>This robot with the click of a button will get what the person is in need of when they are preoccuppied. This would allow that same person to not have to go several blocks or stories to grab just one object. The robot will have an arm (or something to grab the tool), sensors (to navigate) and a motor.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4"> 
      <p><strong>A drone that will take scenery shots from a distance:</strong><br><br>I have always wanted to take scenery shots from above without having to buy a drone or actually go onto such a place out of fear of heights. The user can control this drone through a device (maybe a laptop or a phone). There will need to be a motor that can change speed so the user can determine how much he or she wants to elevate or lower the drone. Finaly, it needs to have a camera to show what you are filming.
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4"> 
      <p><strong>A drone that will clean multiple surfaces:</strong><br><br>Lets say you have a dirty surface (ie. grill, desk, floor). This drone would only need to be a placed on a surface to work its charm. On the places it goes the drone would spurt out soap that it would later scrub and water. With that there will be no need for tedious effort for cleaning.</p>
